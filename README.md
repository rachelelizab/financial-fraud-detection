ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions for a financial company. Since fraud detection is a highly imbalanced problem, the project applies undersampling and uses Logistic Regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

ðŸš€ Steps Covered â€¢ Load dataset and print the number of transactions â€¢ Apply undersampling to balance the dataset â€¢ Split the data into train and test sets â€¢ Train a Logistic Regression model â€¢ Evaluate model performance using: â€¢ ROC Curve â€¢ AUC Score

ðŸ“Š Expected Output â€¢ Count of genuine vs fraudulent transactions â€¢ Balanced dataset distribution after undersampling â€¢ ROC curve visualization â€¢ AUC value as performance metric

ðŸŽ¯ Business Context

The trained model helps the financial company to: â€¢ Detect fraudulent transactions effectively â€¢ Minimize financial losses due to fraud â€¢ Provide an actionable fraud detection plan by integrating the model into transaction monitoring systems

Due to the private nature of financial data, there is a lack of publicly available datasets that can be used for analysis. In this project, a synthetic dataset, publicly available on Kaggle, generated using a simulator called PaySim is used. The dataset was generated using aggregated metrics from the private dataset of a multinational mobile financial services company, and then malicious entries were injected. (TESTIMON @ NTNU, Kaggle). The dataset contains 11 columns of information for ~6 million rows of data. The key columns available are â€“

Type of transactions
Amount transacted
Customer ID and Recipient ID
Old and New balance of Customer and Recipient
Time step of the transaction
Whether the transaction was fraudulent or not
Data Info

The data used for this analysis is a synthetically generated digital transactions dataset using a simulator called PaySim. PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. It aggregates anonymized data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset and then injects fraudulent transactions. The dataset has over 6 million transactions and 11 variables. There is a variable named â€˜isFraudâ€™ that indicates actual fraud status of the transaction. This is the class variable for our analysis. The columns in the dataset are described as follows:

Name of the variable	Description
type	CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.
amount	amount of the transaction in local currency.
nameOrig	customer who started the transaction
oldbalanceOrg	initial balance before the transaction
newbalanceOrig	new balance after the transaction
nameDest	customer who is the recipient of the transaction
oldbalanceDest	initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
newbalanceDest	new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
isFraud	This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
isFlaggedFraud	The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
